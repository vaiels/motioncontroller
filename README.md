# Simple Project
A self contained python codebase to act as a platform to experiment with motion control implementations. This aims to have as few dependencies as possible and be compatible with both Linux and Windows.

### Requirements
Python 3.7
PySimpleGUI


### Classes

#### Kinematic Vehicle Model

#### Path Planner

#### Motion Controller
A class that the user should extend and implement their own functions into in order to make everything work.
Ideas of types of controllers to look at for inspiration:

 - Pure Pursuit
 - Stanley
 - PID

#### Trackmap GUI
